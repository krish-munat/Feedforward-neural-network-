# Feedforward-neural-network-In fact, if you are unfamiliar with the MNIST dataset, you might think 92% accuracy is excellent — and it was, perhaps 20 years ago. Using Convolutional Neural Networks, we can easily obtain > 98% accuracy. Current state-of-the-art approaches can even break 99% accuracy.
In the repository the full code with explanation is given for feed forward neural network 
As the results demonstrate, we are obtaining ≈92% accuracy. Furthermore, the training and validation curves match each other nearly identically, indicating there is no overfitting or issues with the training process.
While on the surface it may appear that our (strictly) fully connected network is performing well, we can actually do much better. And as we’ll see in the next section, strictly fully connected networks applied to more challenging datasets can in some cases do just barely better than guessing randomly.
